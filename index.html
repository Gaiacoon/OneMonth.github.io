		<p>My favorite hobby is junk food. I love exploring nature and visiting humans' houses. I met many animals there! Not all of them liked me though... I am often having existential crises, my recurrent doubt: "am I a bear or a dog?" Food helps me get over this.</p>


		<p>Although humans and other animals don't go crazy for us coons, some of my friends made the cut having cameo roles in hollywood movies. That's the moment I've realized: "Aha, we can all be good actors!". This intuition paved my way into the film industry. One day I've been offered a co-star position in a Marvel movie! Since then I've become rich and famous. Check me out in the video below! </p>
